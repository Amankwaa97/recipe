          Founded in 2024 by Amankwaa, Recipe Finder has come a long way from its beginnings. When Amankwaa first started out, their passion for cooking and sharing recipes with friends and family drove them to start this platform so that Recipe Finder can offer you the best recipe discovery experience. We now serve users all over the world and are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into our own website.
